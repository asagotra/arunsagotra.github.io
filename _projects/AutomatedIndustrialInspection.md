## Digital Transformation of Industries
 Digital transformation and automation of traditional industries and manufacturing practices (Industry 4.0) through leveraging Cloud Computing, Industrial IoT, big data analytics, and AI/ML capabilities can increase  productivity, improve occupational safety and optimize energy consumption.

## Why Automated industrial inspection (A-II)?
Automated industrial inspection (A-II) are  computer vision based predictive solutions that are developed by leveraging state-of-art deep learning models. The goal of A-II is to  automate industrial inspections, a critical component of Industry 4.0. Such automations enable to not only improve productivity, but also lead to significant improvements in operational safety. 

## A-II to detect defects
I've developed an AI based platform along with my team to repurpose this solution along with other components to automatically inspect defects such as cracks, fractures, blockages in wastewater distribution networks for a major customer in North America. A sample detection of cracks and fractures from pipe inspection is shown below.
