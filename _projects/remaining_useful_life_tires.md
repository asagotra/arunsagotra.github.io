## Summary
 Predictive maintenance (PdM) is a popular application of predictive analytics that can help businesses in several industries achieve high asset utilization and savings in operational costs.

## Why predictive maintenance and its importance?
Predictive maintenance is the Industry 4.0 revolution. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the main enablers of Industry 4.0, as it allows machine-to-machine connection and communication where it was not possible or practical before. IoT sensors that are attached to industrial machinery generate data which is then captured, collected, and analyzed.

## How to do it?
As a part of pre-sales team, I have worked with other team members to repurpose this solution along with other components to predict the remaining useful life of tires. We have followed the traditional machine learning approach and trained several machine learning model to predict the tyre depth/wear. Trained model used to estimate future values of tyre depth/wear, and km to replacement of tyres. We used Tyre Measurement from each axle, Tractor( Front and Rear). Remaining useful life of tyres will be on vehicle-tyre based. 

## Conclusion
By forecasting the time needed for a tire to be replaced, a maintenance manager can allocate budget optimally and reduce cost on maintenance and changing tyres at optimal stage of their life cycle, it will help fleets reduce dust from brakes and tyres significantly. Predictive Maintenance manages and monitors large-scale machine units without any fuss.
